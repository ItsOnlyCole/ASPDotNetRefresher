# ASP.Net Core Refresher

This repo is the work I did to refresh myself on how ASP.Net works. It uses .Net Core and Razor to create a page with a list of usersubmitted movies.

the work in this repo is based from the tutorial, [ASPNetCore-For-Beginners](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/aspnetcore-for-beginners).
